Discover what makes ASP.NET Core 9 a powerful and versatile framework for building modern web APIs that are both scalable and secure. This comprehensive, recipe-based guide equips developers with the knowledge to create robust web API solutions using the framework's most powerful features.
Designed for intermediate to advanced .NET developers, this cookbook contains hands-on recipes that demonstrate how to efficiently build, optimize, and secure APIs using this cutting-edge technology. You'll master essential topics like creating RESTful APIs, implementing advanced data access strategies, securing your APIs, creating custom middleware, and enhancing your logging capabilities. The book goes beyond traditional API development by introducing GraphQL, SignalR, and gRPC, offering insights into how these technologies can extend the reach of your APIs. To prepare you for real-world challenges, the recipes cover testing methodologies, cloud deployment, legacy system integration, and advanced concepts like microservices and Hangfire.
By the end of this book, you’ll gain the expertise needed to build and manage enterprise-grade web APIs with ASP.NET Core 9.</details>
